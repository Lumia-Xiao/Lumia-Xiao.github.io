- Hello, I’m Xiao Ziheng (肖子衡)!
- I received the B.S. degree in electrical engineering and automation and Ph.D. degree (supervised by Professor [An Luo 罗安](https://eeit.hnu.edu.cn/info/1322/4500.htm) , member of Chinese engineering academy) in electrical engineering from the College of Electrical and Information Engineering, Hunan University, Changsha, China, in 2017 and 2022, respectively. 
- Since 2022, I have been a Research Fellow with the Energy Research Institute at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. Since 2023, I have also served as a part-time lecturer in the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at the same university. 
- My main research interests include the medium voltage dc system, dual active bridge converters, resonant converters, energy router in renewable energy systems, and the application of artificial intelligence in power electronics. 
 
- I was a recipient of the Best Paper Award First Prize in ECCE Asia in 2024. I also served as the Session chair for the 49th Annual Conference of the IEEE Industrial Electronics Society.


Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](https://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and Markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a Markdown file for a talk

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
