This course, co-taught by Prof. Tang Yi and Dr. Xiao Ziheng, provides a comprehensive, simulation-driven introduction to clean energy power electronic systems using PLECS simulation software. It progresses from fundamental modeling of solar cells and basic DC-DC converters to advanced simulation of three-phase inverters and complete renewable energy systems. Each lecture integrates theoretical concepts with hands-on simulation exercises, emphasizing practical modeling techniques, parameter selection, and performance validation through simulation. Students will develop expertise in using PLECS for maximum power point tracking implementation, converter control loop design, frequency domain analysis via Bode plots, grid synchronization algorithms, and system-level integration of PV-wind-storage hybrid systems. Through this simulation-focused approach, the course equips students with practical skills to design, analyze, and optimize power electronic systems for modern clean energy applications.
