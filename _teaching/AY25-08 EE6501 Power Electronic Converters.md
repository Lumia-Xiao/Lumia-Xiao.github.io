This course, co-taught by Dr. Xiao Ziheng and Prof. Tang Yi, provides a comprehensive and systematic introduction to modern power electronics, covering the fundamental principles of semiconductor switches, power converter topologies, and their critical applications in grid-connected renewable energy systems. It progresses methodically from the foundational concepts of power electronic devices and converter modeling to the advanced design and control of three-phase inverters for grid integration. The second half of the course shifts focus to the essential building blocks of clean energy systems, delving into the steady-state operation, modeling, and control of DC-DC converters and AC-DC rectifiers. Emphasis is placed on modulation techniques, closed-loop control design, system-level application challenges, and the integration of power converters into functional systems. Through structured lectures, targeted assessments including two quizzes, and integrated revision sessions, the course equips students with both a solid theoretical foundation and practical insights into the design and operation of power electronic systems for contemporary energy applications.
