excerpt: 'The dynamic performance of dual active bridge (DAB) converters is crucial in various applications. Conventional linear control methods, while straightforward, are often limited to specific modulation schemes and vary in their optimal control parameters across different operating conditions. Conversely, nonlinear control methods improve steady-state performance but typically necessitate conservative settings for control parameters to mitigate sensitivity issues, which may adversely affect dynamic performance. This article addresses these challenges by examining transitions in DAB converters while maintaining a specified current limit, focusing on swift and seamless entry into peak current operations in both constant frequency (CF) and varying frequency (VF) modes. A state machine diagram is detailed, and the corresponding control algorithm is implemented in the controller of a 1.4-kW DAB experimental prototype for real-time cycle-by-cycle control. Comparative experimental results reveal that the proposed transitions in CF and VF modes can enhance dynamic transition speeds by 80%–150% over existing methods, without the need for empirical online fine-tuning of control parameters. Specifically, VF mode demonstrates superior performance in low power and low peak current scenarios, while CF mode is more effective under high power and high peak current conditions.'
