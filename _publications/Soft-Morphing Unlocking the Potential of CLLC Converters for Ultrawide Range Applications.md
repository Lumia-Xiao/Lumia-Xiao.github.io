excerpt: 'Expanding the voltage gain regulation range while preserving high efficiency of CLLC resonant converters is crucial yet challenging. Previous methods typically expanded the voltage gain range at the expense of a reduced efficiency. This article aims to unlock the full potential of CLLC resonant converters using full-bridge (FB) and half-bridge (HB) soft-morphing techniques. Two forms of soft-morphing are analyzed and developed: type1, steady-state rotational soft-morphing, which ensures balanced power loss and thermal stress across all power switches, and type2, dynamic soft-morphing, which facilitates smooth transitions between FB-FB, FB-HB, and HB-FB modes. Consequently, the full potential of the FB CLLC resonant converter is unlocked, achieving a 16× ultrawide voltage gain range. Building on this, a synergy control method is proposed and implemented on a 2-kW CLLC resonant converter prototype. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method facilitates seamless soft-morphing between different operation modes and maintains well-balanced power loss across different power switches. Furthermore, an ultraflat efficiency curve is achieved, indicating that the proposed method maintains high efficiency across various operating scenarios.
